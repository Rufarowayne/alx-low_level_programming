README.md
_putchar.c
create_static_lib.sh
holberton.h
libholberton.a
The README.md file contains information about the contents of the directory and how to use them. The _putchar.c file contains a function that writes a character to stdout. The create_static_lib.sh file is a shell script that creates a static library called libholberton.a from all the .c files in the current directory. The holberton.h file contains all the function prototypes used in the .c files. Finally, the libholberton.a file is the static library created by the shell script.

If you want to learn more about static libraries, I suggest you check out the resources mentioned in the README.md file.
